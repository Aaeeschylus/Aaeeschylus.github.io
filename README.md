Welcome. I have created this for the game known as "Girls Frontline." In the game, you create new "dolls" by inputting a number of resources; Manpower, Ammo, Rations and Parts. Depending on the amount of each resource you put in, will depend on which dolls you can craft. The end result is always random, however depending on the "recipe" you put in, will depend on the pool of dolls you can randomly get. 

The purpose of this calculator is to show you the pool of dolls you can get with a given recipe. Please do contact me on Discord (Aaeeschylus#6645) if you have any suggestions, find any bugs or find any errors.
